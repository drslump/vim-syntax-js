# Vim syntax file for JavaScript

A brand new Vim syntax for JavaScript with fine tuned grouping and optional
conceal features.

> It has only tested been tested with Vim 7.2 so it might not fully work on 
  previous versions.


## Folding

This syntax supports pretty decent folding which you can activate with:

    set foldmethod=syntax

You can add the above line to your `ftplugin` or in your _vimrc_ using:

    au FileType javascript setl foldmethod=syntax


## Conceals

To activate conceals with these commands:

    set conceallevel=2
    set concealcursor=nc  " don't reveal the conceals unless on insert or visual modes

Add the above lines to your `ftplugin` or in your _vimrc_ with:

    au FileType javascript setl conceallevel=2 concelcursor=nc

You'll also need to indicate which conceals you want to apply by using the 
`g:syntax_js` list variable in your _vimrc_ file:

    let g:syntax_js=['function', 'return']

The availabe options are

  - **function**   replace `function` keywords with ùëì
  - **semicolon**  hide semicolons if they are the last char in a line
  - **comma**      hide commas if the are the last char in a line
  - **return**     replace `return` keywords with ‚Ü©
  - **this**       use Ruby style `@prop` instead of `this.prop`
  - **proto**      replace `.prototype.` with ‚Üí
  - **solarized**  fine-tunes the highlighing for the [solarized](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized) 
                   color scheme with a light background
  - **debug**      Shows the syntax groups stack in the status line

This is how it looks on MacVim when enabling all the options on a light background [solarized](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized) 
and Inconsolata as type face.
